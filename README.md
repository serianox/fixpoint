Fixpoint
========

Empty, experimental, *and mostly useless*, implementation of [fixed-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) using new features from C++11.

TODO

Fails at nearly everything, but one could use the idea for a C++ sugar for [libfixmath](https://code.google.com/p/libfixmath/).
